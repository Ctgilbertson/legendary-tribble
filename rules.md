# X-Team 110 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) task.

Share workload evenly and if someone is having trouble with their part do what we can to help them without taking over task. If a task needs to be reassigned for any reason ask if anyone would be willing or give it to whoever has least workload. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Set deadlines for things and hold eachother accountable for them. Let the group know when you finish your task. 

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Be open and honest if we can do something or don't know how. Be understanding of people who don't know how to do something and try to assist/teach them.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Hold eachother accountable for our tasks. Meet before dealine to make sure that things are on track to get done on time.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
